# Fresh Track

Hi, welcome to FreshTrack, a team project for the Women Who Code 2023 Hackathon for Social Good!
This project was bootstrapped using Create React App, and it uses React Native for Web, Django/Python and PostgreSQL.

## Challenge Statement

Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted globally, contributing to environmental degradation. FreshTrack aims to make a significant impact on this issue by empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their food consumption. By reducing food waste in households, we are not just saving money but also making a positive environmental difference.

## Running the app

Since the app is not currently hosted anywhere, you will need to run the frontend and the backend locally.  

For the front end, follow these steps:

• clone the repository locally
• `cd frontend` to change directory to frontend
• run `npm install` to install the necessary modules
• run `npm start` to start the app

At the moment, you can login by entering a random email and password. The authorization flow is still a work in progress so React is managing the authentication using state. 



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

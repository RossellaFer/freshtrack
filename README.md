# Freshtrack
Hi, welcome to FreshTrack, a team project for the [Women Who Code 2023 Hackathon for Social Good](https://hopin.com/events/wwcode-hackathon-for-social-good/registration)! 


### Challenge Statement
Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted globally, contributing to environmental degradation. FreshTrack aims to make a significant impact on this issue by empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their food consumption. By reducing food waste in households, we are not just saving money but also making a positive environmental difference.

### Running the app
Since the app is not currently hosted anywhere, you will need to run the frontend and the backend locally. 
For the front end, follow these steps:

- clone the repository locally
- `cd frontend` to change directory to frontend
- run `npm install` to install the necessary modules
- run `npm run` to start the app
